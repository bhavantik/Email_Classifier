Data: Please download the "A subset of about 1700 labelled email messages" from https://bailando.berkeley.edu/enron_email.html
Procedure:

2.	 Purely Personal 
3.	Personal but in professional context (e.g., it was good working with you) 
4.	Logistic Arrangements (meeting scheduling, technical support, etc) 
5.	Employment arrangements (job seeking, hiring, recommendations, etc) 
6.	Document editing/checking (collaboration) 

•	Train and test the model and report the performance
